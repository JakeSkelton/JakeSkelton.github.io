<!-- Hello, I'm Jake Skelton, a physics masters student at Cambridge university.
The purpose of this site is to act as a respository for projects of mine, big and small. Chiefly, I'm interested in condensed matter, statistical, and computational physics, so I hope to fill the site with code, equations, and circuit schematics. -->

Hello, I'm Jake Skelton, a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh working in applied maths, having previously completed an undergraduate and a master's degree in physics at Cambridge University. The purpose of this site is to act as a respository for projects of mine, big and small (although it is leaning to the big, and academic side for the time being). My chief interest is writing fast code to simulate physical phenomena, but I am fascinated by lots of topics besides this, and have jumped around plenty over the years.
