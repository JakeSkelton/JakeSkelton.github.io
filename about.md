# About

<img src="/assets/images/headshot.jpg" align="right" width=300px />
Hello, I'm Jake Skelton, a physics masters student at Cambridge university.
The purpose of this site is to act as a respository for projects of mine, big and small. Chiefly, I'm interested in condensed matter, statistical, and computational physics, so I hope to fill the site with code, equations, and circuit schematics; my fondness for music technology and bike mechanics will lend some influence too.
